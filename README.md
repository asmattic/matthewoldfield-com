a user's need.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified
to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and
use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from
[Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use
[heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over
here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and
image component is passed.

`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more
information.

```

tags (required, can be empty array)
lastmod (optional)
draft (optional)

## Deploy

**Vercel**  
Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.

The API routes used in the newsletter component cannot be used in a static site export. You will
need to use a form API endpoint provider and substitute the route in the newsletter component
accordingly. Other hosting platforms such as Netlify also offer alternative solutions - please refer
to their docs for more information.

A multi-purpose React, MongoDB, Node application for
regularly aggregating key analytics data from approximately 150 client
instances of the customer facing manufacturing and distribution sales CRM to
measure client adoption and usage.


Developed an onboarding tool integrated into that application to clean human
created lists containing hundreds of thousands of companies and contacts each
by employing Data Science techniques of normalizing data types, grouping
company locations, filling in often missing fields from multiple location and
company/contact information APIâ€™s, finding and removing duplicates,
connecting companies with their related contacts and mapping the cleaned
data to the required import format for use in the CRM.
